# Select tool

Select tool is a demo project exploring the Selection API. When text is selected, it exposes a twitter share button, that, when clicked, is opening a separate window for twitting the selected text.

### Tech

Select tool is written in pure ES6, with sass for styling and webpack + babel as build/transpiling tools. It also uses Twitter SDK to show up the twitter window and is also optimized for mobile viewing experience.
